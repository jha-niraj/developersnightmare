# React Component Memoization: Stop Unnecessary Re-Renders!

## The Problem
React re-renders components whenever state or props change, even if the component‚Äôs output is unchanged. In complex apps‚Äîthink dashboards, e-commerce sites, or forms‚Äîthis can lead to sluggish UIs, frustrated users, and poor performance.

## The Solution: Memoization
Memoization ‚Äúcaches‚Äù components, values, or functions so React only updates them when necessary. React provides three tools for this:

1. **React.memo**: Prevents a component from re-rendering if its props are unchanged. Ideal for static UI elements.
2. **useMemo**: Caches expensive calculations (e.g., data processing) to avoid recomputing on every render.
3. **useCallback**: Stabilizes functions to prevent unnecessary re-renders in child components that depend on them.

## Code Examples
This folder contains three React components, each showcasing one memoization tool:
- `MemoizedButton.jsx`: Uses `React.memo` to prevent a button from re-rendering unless its props change.
- `FilteredList.jsx`: Uses `useMemo` to cache a filtered list, avoiding expensive computations.
- `StableCallbackInput.jsx`: Uses `useCallback` to keep an event handler stable, preventing a child input from re-rendering.

## How to Use
1. Check out each `.jsx` file for a focused example.
2. Run them in a React project (e.g., via CDN or Create React App).
3. Use React DevTools to observe re-render behavior with and without memoization.
4. Apply these techniques in your app where performance bottlenecks occur.

## When to Use
- **React.memo**: For components like buttons, cards, or navbars that don‚Äôt change often.
- **useMemo**: For heavy computations, like filtering, sorting, or transforming large datasets.
- **useCallback**: For functions passed as props to child components, especially in forms or event-driven UIs.

## Pro Tips
- **Measure first**: Use React Profiler to identify re-render issues before applying memoization.
- **Avoid overuse**: Memoization adds overhead, so reserve it for components or calculations that measurably impact performance.
- **Combine tools**: Pair `useCallback` with `React.memo` for optimal results in parent-child setups.
