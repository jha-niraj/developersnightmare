# Quick Concept 🚀

Welcome to **Quick Concept** – a collection of frustrating dev problems that should’ve taken 5 minutes but somehow turned into a 5-hour rabbit hole. 🕳️

This repo is a growing archive of annoying, time-consuming issues you might face while building web apps (especially with React and modern JavaScript tools). Each post is a no-fluff breakdown of what went wrong and how to fix it without losing your sanity.

Whether it's a rogue config file, mysterious error, or a “simple” integration gone sideways — this is your place for copy-pasteable solutions and a bit of sarcasm to keep things fun. 😎
